# Genshin-Dialogue-Clicker
Genshin's dialogue sequences are very long, story very mid, and clicking the response choices stops the auto from continuing. I found clicking through endless dialogue tedious and unfun so here's a script that does it.

Set up:
 - Unzip/extract all files into same directory
 - You'll need autohotkey v1 for the macro to work (https://www.autohotkey.com/)
 - Run auto_clicker.ahk to start listening for macro
 - To start auto clicker, ALT+F12
 - To end auto clicker, escape key

If you want this macro to always be active so you don't have to run ahk every boot up, place it in your start up folder
